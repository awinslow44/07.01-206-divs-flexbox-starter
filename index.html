                I was born and raised in San Francisco, CA. I've pretty much lived in California my entire life asides from a brief year in Florida. We missed the foggy city so much we decided to move back. I can truly say my heart will always be with San Francisco despite living in Los Angeles for the better part of my adult years.

                My passion is growth as a general. I love learning and growing. Camping is a huge part of my life as is hiking. We are big animal family as seen by the two kitties and two dogs we are blessed to call family.

                I'm thankful to be learning again as I take these Skillcrush courses! I've always been fairly tech saavy and love that a career in the tech industry isn't as daunting as some make it out to be. I'm excited for this new chapter of my life!
